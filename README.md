10. **Ethical Aspects of XAI**
    - Responsibility in using XAI.
    - Societal impacts of explanation models.

11. **XAI in Practice**
    - Integrating XAI into the development process.
    - Application of frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Explain).

12. **The Future of XAI**
    - Trends and open research questions.
    - Discussion and summary.

# Class policies
<a name="policies"/>

Attendance will not be taken, but **you are responsible for knowing what happens in every class**. If you cannot attend class, make sure you check up with someone who was there.

Respect your classmates and your instructor by preventing distractions. This means be on time, turn off your cellphone, and save side conversations for after class. If you can't read something I wrote on the board, or if you think I made a mistake in a derivation, please raise your hand and tell me!

**Using a laptop in class is likely to reduce your education attainment**. This has been documented by multiple studies, which are nicely summarized in the following article:

- https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html

I am not going to ban laptops, as long as they are not a distraction to anyone but the user. But I suggest you try pen and paper for a few weeks, and see if it helps.

## Collaboration policy

One of the goals of the assigned work is to assess your individual progress in meeting the learning objectives of the course. You may discuss the homework and projects with other students, but your work must be your own -- particularly all coding and writing. For example:

- It is allowed to discuss ideas of implementation, problems and concepts. How do algorithms work? What is the difference between various implementations? Which is the more efficient or elegant solutions.

- Solutions should not be copied from others but rather demonstrate one's own capability of solving a task or an issue. It is not acceptable to solve parts and exchange these with other students. Each code must be one's own contribution.

Using other people’s text or figures without attribution is plagiarism, and is never acceptable.
