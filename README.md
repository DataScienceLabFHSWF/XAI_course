# Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI)

This repository serves as a companion to our Explainable AI (xAI) Course, heavily inspired by Christoph Molnarâ€™s Interpretable Machine Learning book. The course covers core concepts, methods, and tools for understanding and interpreting machine learning models, ensuring transparency, trust, and fairness in AI systems.

Inside, you'll find:

    Lecture Notes & Slides summarizing key xAI techniques

    Hands-on Notebooks demonstrating real-world interpretability methods

    Code Implementations of SHAP, LIME, Feature Importance, and more

    Resources & Further Readings to deepen your understanding

Whether you're a researcher, practitioner, or enthusiast, this repository will help you master the art of making machine learning models more interpretable and accountable. ðŸš€

# Class policies
<a name="policies"/>

Attendance will not be taken, but **you are responsible for knowing what happens in every class**. If you cannot attend class, make sure you check up with someone who was there.

Respect your classmates and your instructor by preventing distractions. This means be on time, turn off your cellphone, and save side conversations for after class. If you can't read something I wrote on the board, or if you think I made a mistake in a derivation, please raise your hand and tell me!

**Using a laptop in class is likely to reduce your education attainment**. This has been documented by multiple studies, which are nicely summarized in the following article:

I am not going to ban laptops, as long as they are not a distraction to anyone but the user. But I suggest you try pen and paper for a few weeks, and see if it helps.

## Collaboration policy

One of the goals of the assigned work is to assess your individual progress in meeting the learning objectives of the course. You may discuss the homework and projects with other students, but your work must be your own -- particularly all coding and writing. For example:

- It is allowed to discuss ideas of implementation, problems and concepts. How do algorithms work? What is the difference between various implementations? Which is the more efficient or elegant solutions.

- Solutions should not be copied from others but rather demonstrate one's own capability of solving a task or an issue. It is not acceptable to solve parts and exchange these with other students. Each code must be one's own contribution.

Using other peopleâ€™s text or figures without attribution is plagiarism, and is never acceptable.
